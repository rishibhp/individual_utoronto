		<p>Hi! My name is Rishibh Prakash and I am/will be studying mathematics as a Master's student at the University of Toronto. I also did my undergraduate at the University of Toronto in Mathematics (specialist) and Computer Science (Major). I find the vast majority of things interesting and am always excited to learn more. I am currently working with Professor Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero on the Krzy≈º conjecture, a statement discussing uniform bounds on the Taylor coefficients of non-vanishing analytic functions from the unit disk to the unit disk. </p>
		<p>Among these pages, you'll be able to find some of the different things I've worked on/am working on (e.g. notes from previous classes, some previous assignments, some of my writing, and even some crosswords I've made in the past). Anything I have made, you are more than welcome to use and share without asking me for permission (although I would love to hear it if something I have made has turned out useful!).</p>
